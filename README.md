## Highway Escape
A simple 2D racing game built using iGraphics as an academic project.

iGraphics is a wrapper for OpenGL in 2D.
iGraphics.h header file contains some drawing functions that can be
used to draw basic graphical shapes in Visual C++. These functions
are implemented in openGL. Users of iGraphics do not need any
knowledge of openGL to use it. Simply calling the drawing functions a
user can draw any 2D shape on screen. This library also provides easy
ways for animation, keyboard and mouse event handling.
